typeoftype guards

As weâ€™ve seen, JavaScript supports a typeof operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime. TypeScript expects this to return a certain set of strings:

- "string"
- "number"
- "bigint"
- "boolean"
- "symbol"
- "undefined"
- "object"
- "function"
