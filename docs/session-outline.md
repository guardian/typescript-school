# Session Outline

A proposal for how we hope to structure each session; a rough guide only, it doesn't have to be prescriptive.

**Session Length**: 50 minutes

## Session Structure

1. Learning Objectives/Outcomes - a brief outline of the topics we're going to cover.
2. Presentation - the main presenter works through some slides or a demonstration, explaining the topics.
3. Activities - participants get to work on tasks themselves, be it on their own, in break out rooms, or all together.
4. Review - go over the tasks, and cover any questions.
